## Hi, I'm Thomas ðŸ‘‹

### I'm a Full-stack Web Developer.

I started my journey to become a web developer last year and since then I've never stopped learning. 
My stack is mainly based on Javascript, React, Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB which allows me to work on full-stack projects. 

I'm based in Bordeaux, France :wine_glass: and I'm currently looking for a new job / internship opportunity :briefcase:  
I was formerly working as a Sales Executive in leading tech companies such as SAP. More info on my resume ! 

#### On my Github you will find...

... several Full-stack projects that I have accomplished either alone or following tutorials.  
Some of them are still under construction :construction:

Here are a few examples of my various projects:
1. The classical To Do List 
2. Marvel Characters 
3. Deliveroo Clone 
4. Vinted Clone
